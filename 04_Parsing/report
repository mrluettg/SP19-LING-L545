In general, the algorithm that chooses the dependencies will most likely choose 
the same POS as in the testing data, though may choose other ones. This leads 
to the algorithm overestimating or underestimating the length of the clause. 
It is unlikely
that the ROOT will be mistaken, as it only happened in one of the trees. Often, 
it will get confused between the dependencies in clauses.
